# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.7 Bit-Level Operations in C

- C supports bitwise Boolean operations: `|` for *OR*, `&` for *AND*, `~` for *NOT*, and `^` for *EXCLUSIVE-OR*. These can be applied to any "integral" data type.
- The best way to determine the effect of a bit-level expression is to expand the hexadecimal arguments to their binary representations, perform the operations in binary, and then convert back to hexadecimal.
- One common use of bit-level operations is to implement *masking* operations, where a mask is a bit pattern that indicates a selected set of bits within a word.
- The expression `~0` will yield a mask of all ones, regardless of the size of the data representation (*portable*).
