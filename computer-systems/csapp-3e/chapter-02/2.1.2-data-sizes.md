# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.2 Data Sizes
- Every computer has a word size, indicating the nominal size of pointer data. Since a virtual address is encoded by such a word, the most important system parameter determined by the word size is the maximum size of the virtual address space.
- For a machine with a *w*-bit word size, the virtual addresses can range from `0` to `2w-1`, giving the program access to at most `2w` bytes.
- The exact numbers of bytes for some data types depends on how the program is compiled. 
- Integer data can be either *signed*, able to represent negative, zero, and positive values, or *unsigned*, only allowing nonnegative values.
- To avoid the vagaries of relying on "typical" sizes and different compiler settings, *ISO C99* introduced a class of data types where the data sizes are fixed regardless of compiler and machine settings. Among these are data types `int32_t` and `int64_t`, having exactly 4 and 8 bytes, respectively.
- The declaration `signed char` should be used to guarantee a 1-byte signed value.
- Most machines also support two different floating-point formats: single precision, declared in C as `float` (4 bytes), and double precision, declared in C as `double` (8 bytes).
