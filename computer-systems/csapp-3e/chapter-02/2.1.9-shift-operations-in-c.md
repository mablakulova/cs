# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.9 Shift Operations in C
- C also provides a set of *shift* operations for shifting bit patterns to the left and to the right. 
- In the *left shift* operation, *x* (`[x(w-1), x(w-2), ..., x(0)]`) is shifted *k* bits to the left, dropping off the *k* most significant bits and filling the right end with *k* zeros: `x << k` yields a value with bit representation `[x(w-k-1), x(w-k-2), ..., x(0), 0, ..., 0]`. The shift amount should be a value between 0 and w-1.
- Shift operations associate from left to right, so `x << j << k` is equivalent to `(x << j) << k`.
- Machines support two forms of *right shift* (`x >> k`):
  - *Logical* right shift fills the left end with *k* zeros, giving a result `[0, ..., 0, x(w-1), x(w-2), ... x(k)]`.
  - *Arithmetic* right shift fills the left end with k repetitions of the most significant bit, giving a result `[x(w-1), ..., x(w-1), x(w-1), x(w-2), ... x(k)]`.
- The C standards do not precisely define which type of right shift should be used with signed numbers-either arithmetic or logical shifts may be used. Any code assuming one form or the other will potentially encounter *portability* problems. 
- In practice, arithmetic right shifts are used for signed data, while for unsigned data, right shifts must be logical.
- In Java, the expression `x >> k` shifts x arithmetically by k positions, while `x >>> k` shifts it logically.

## Aside: Shifting by k, for large values of k
- The C standards carefully avoid stating the effect of shifting a data type consisting of *w* bits by *k >= w*.
- On many machines, the shift instructions consider only the lower *logâ‚‚w* bits of the shift amount when shifting a *w-bit* value, and so the shift amount is computed as *k mod w*.
- This behavior is not guaranteed for C programs, however, and so shift amounts should be kept less than the word size.

## Aside: Operator precedence issues with shift operations
- Addition (and subtraction) have higher *precedence* than shifts. 1 << 2 + 3 << 4 is equivalent to 1 << (2+3) << 4.
- When in doubt, put in parentheses!.
