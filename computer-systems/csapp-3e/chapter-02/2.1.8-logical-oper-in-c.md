# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.8 Logical Operations in C
- C also provides a set of *logical operators* `||`, `&&`, and `!`, which correspond to the *OR*, *AND*, and *NOT* operations of logic. The logical operations treat any nonzero argument as representing *TRUE* and argument `0` as representing *FALSE*. They return either 1 or 0, indicating a result of either *TRUE* or *FALSE*, respectively.
- The logical operators do not evaluate their second argument if the result of the expression can be determined by evaluating the first argument.
