## 2.2.4 Conversions between Signed and Unsigned
- The effect of casting between signed and unsigned numbers is to keep the bit values identical but change how these bits are interpreted. This is a general rule for how most C implementations handle conversions between signed and unsigned numbers with the same word size-the numeric values might change, but the bit patterns do not.
- T2U(w)(x) = B2U(w)(T2B(w)(x)) where TMin(w) ≤ x ≤ TMax(w);
- U2T(w)(x) = B2T(w)(U2B(w)(x)) where 0 ≤ x ≤ UMax(w);
- *Principle*: Conversion from two's complement to unsigned for x such that TMin(w) ≤ x ≤ TMax(w):
$$
T2U_w(x) =
\begin{cases} 
x + 2^w, & x < 0 \\
x, & x \geq 0
\end{cases}
$$
- *Principle*: Unsigned to two's complement conversion for u such that 0 ≤ u ≤ UMax(w):
$$
U2T_w(u) =
\begin{cases} 
u, & u ≤ TMax(w) \\
u - 2^w, & u > TMax(w)
\end{cases}
$$
