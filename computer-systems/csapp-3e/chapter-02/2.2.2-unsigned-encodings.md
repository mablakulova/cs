## 2.2.2 Unsigned Encodings
- Definition of unsigned encoding for vector x = [x(w-1), x(w-2), ..., x(0)]: 
$$
B2U(w)(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{w-1} x(i) \cdot 2^i
$$
- The least value for vector x is 0, and the greatest value is 
$$
UMax(w) = \sum_{i=0}^{w-1} 2^i = 2^w - 1
$$
- The unsigned binary representation has the important property that every number between 0 and 2^w - 1 has a unique encoding as a w-bit value.
- Uniqueness of unsigned encoding function `B2U(w)` is a *bijection*. Which means the function `B2U(w)` maps each bit vector of length w to a unique number between 0 and 2^w - 1, and it has an *inverse*, which we call `U2B(w)` (for "unsigned to binary"), that maps each number in the range 0 to 2^w - 1 to a unique pattern of w bits.
