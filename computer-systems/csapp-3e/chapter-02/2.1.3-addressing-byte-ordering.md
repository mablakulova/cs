# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.3 Addressing and Byte Ordering
- For program objects that span multiple bytes, we must establish two conventions: *what the address of the object will be*, and *how we will order the bytes in memory*.
- For a *w*-bit integer having a bit representation [x(w−1), x(w−2), ..., x(1), x(0)], `x(w−1)` is the most *significant* bit and `x(0)` is the least. Assuming *w* is a multiple of 8, these bits can be grouped as bytes, with the most significant byte having bits [x(w−1), x(w−2), ..., x(w−8)], the least significant byte having bits [x(7), x(6), ..., x(0)], and the other bytes having bits from the middle. 
- In *little endian* convention, the object in memory are stored from the least significant byte to most, while in the *big endian* convention the most significant byte comes first.
- Many recent microprocessor chips are *bi-endian*, meaning that they can be configured to operate as either little- or big-endian machines. In practice, however, byte ordering becomes fixed once a particular operating system is chosen.
- At times, byte ordering becomes an issue:
    - binary data are communicated over a network between different machines
    - looking at the byte sequences representing integer data when inspecting machine-level programs
    - programs are written that circumvent the normal type system - in the C language, using a *cast* or a *union*
