# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.1 Hexadecimal Notation
- A single byte consists of 8 bits. In *binary* notation, its value ranges from `00000000₂` to `11111111₂`. When viewed as a *decimal* integer, its value ranges from `0₁₀` to `255₁₀`.
- *Hexadecimal* (or simply "hex") uses digits '0' through '9' along with characters 'A' through 'F' to represent 16 possible values. Written in hexadecimal, the value of a single byte can range from `00₁₆` to `FF₁₆`.
- In C, numeric constants starting with `0x` or `0X` are interpreted as being in hexadecimal. The characters 'A' through 'F' may be written in either upper- or lowercase.
- We can convert *hexadecimal* to *binary* format by expanding each hexadecimal digit, `0x173A4C₁₆` gives the binary representation `000101110011101001001100₂`.
- A binary number are converted to hexadecimal by first splitting it into groups of 4 bits each. Note, however, that if the total number of bits is not a multiple of 4, you should make the *leftmost* group be the one with fewer than 4 bits, effectively padding the number with leading zeros. Then you translate each group of bits into the corresponding hexadecimal digit: `1111001010110110110011₂` = `0x3CADB3₁₆`.
- When a value *x* is a power of 2, that is `x = 2^n` for some nonnegative integer *n*, *x* can be readily written in hexadecimal form by the binary representation of x is simply 1 followed by *n* zeros: `x = 2048₁₀ = 2^11 = 100000000000₂ = 0x800₁₆`.
- To convert a *decimal* number `x` to *hexadecimal*, we can repeatedly divide `x` by 16, giving a quotient `q` and a remainder `r`, such that `x = q × 16 + r`. We then use the hexadecimal digit representing `r` as the least significant digit and generate the remaining digits by repeating the process on `q`.
- To convert a *hexadecimal* number to *decimal*, we can multiply each of the hexadecimal digits by the appropriate power of 16: `0x7AF₁₆ = 7 × 16^2 + 10 × 16 + 15 = 1967`.
