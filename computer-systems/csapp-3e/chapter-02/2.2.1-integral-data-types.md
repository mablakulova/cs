# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.2.1 Integral Data Types
- C supports a variety of *integral* data types - ones that represent finite ranges of integers.
- The only machine-dependent range indicated is for size designator `long`. Most 64-bit programs use an 8-byte representation, while the 4-byte representation used with 32-bit programs.
- The C standards define minimum ranges of values that each data type must be able to represent.
