# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.2.3 Two’s-Complement Encodings
- The most common computer representation of signed numbers is known as *two's-complement* form. This is defined by interpreting the most significant bit of the word to have negative weight.
- Definition of two's-complement encoding for vector x = [x(w-1), x(w-2), ..., x(0)]: 
$$
B2T(w)(x) = -x(w-1) \cdot 2^{w-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{w-2} x(i) \cdot 2^i
$$
- The most significant bit x(w-1) is also called the *sign bit*. Its "weight" is −2^(w-1), the negation of its weight in an unsigned representation.
- The least value is given by bit vector x is `TMin(w) = -2^(w-1)` and the greatest value is 
$$
TMax(w) = \sum_{i=0}^{w-2} 2^i = 2^{w-1} - 1
$$
- Uniqueness of two's-complement encoding function `B2T(w)` is a *bijection*. We define function `T2B(w)` (for "two’s complement to binary") to be the inverse
of `B2T(w)`. That is, for a number x, such that TMin(w) ≤ x ≤ TMax(w), `T2B(w)(x)` is the (unique) w-bit pattern that encodes x.
- The two’s-complement range is asymmetric: `|TMin| = |TMax| + 1`; that is, there is no positive counterpart to `TMin`.
- The maximum unsigned value is just over twice the maximum two’s-complement value: `UMax = 2TMax + 1`.

## Aside: More on fixed-size integer types
- The ISO C99 standard introduces fixed-size integer types in the file `stdint.h` and defines a set of data types with declarations of the form `intN_t` and `uintN_t`, specifying N-bit signed and unsigned integers, for different values of N.
- There are a set of macros defining the minimum and maximum values for each value of N. These have names of the form `INTN_MIN`, `INTN_MAX`, and `UINTN_MAX`.
