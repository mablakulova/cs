# Chapter 2 Representing and Manipulating Information

## 2.1.5 Representing Code
- Different machine types use different and incompatible instructions and encodings. Even identical processors running different operating systems have differences in their coding conventions and hence are not binary compatible. Binary code is seldom portable across different combinations of machine and operating system.

## Aside: The Unicode standard for text encoding
- The *ASCII character* set is suitable for encoding English-language documents, but it does not have much in the way of special characters.
- The *Unicode Consortium* has devised the most comprehensive and widely accepted standard for encoding text. The current *Unicode* standard (version 7.0) has a repertoire of over 100,000 characters supporting a wide range of languages.
- The base encoding, known as the "Universal Character Set" of Unicode, uses a 32-bit representation of characters. This would seem to require every string of text to consist of 4 bytes per character.
- The *UTF-8* representation encodes each character as a sequence of bytes, such that the standard ASCII characters use the same single-byte encodings as they have in ASCII, implying that all ASCII byte sequences have the same meaning in UTF-8 as they do in ASCII.
